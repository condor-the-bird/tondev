TON Labs Client Libraries provide [TON Dev](https://ton.dev/) community with functionality that allows your applications to interact with blockchain. All functions are divided into:

- **crypto** – most cryptography functions required to work with blockchain.
- **contracts** - interaction with nodes to deploy and run smart contracts on the blockchain.
- **queries** – monitoring and querying realtime data. The functionality relies on an indexing database over blockchain.

Regardless of the selected language, each library usage follows the same principles. There is a similar set of modules, functions and their respective parameters.

Each TON Labs Client Library is stateful, so at the first step you have to create an instance of a TON Labs Client object, configure it and setup. Usually, all three actions are performed by a single call to the relevant TON Labs Client constructor.
